# dotfiles

The following are the dotfiles for a range of window managers and desktop environments:

1. [Fedora XFCE](https://github.com/dajhub/dotfiles/tree/master/Fedora%20-%20xfce)
2. [Qtile](https://github.com/dajhub/dotfiles/tree/master/qtile)
3. [BSPWM](https://github.com/dajhub/dotfiles/tree/master/BSPWM)

They are for my personal use but feel free to browse!!

To do:
- Add software/fonts required for window managers.
