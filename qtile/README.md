Used [Endeavour OS](https://endeavouros.com/) as the base Arch install (so much easier!) and installed Budgie desktop before installing [qtile](http://www.qtile.org/).  Rather than Budgie I could (or should?) have installed xfce as it is more minimal.
  However, I also wanted to experiment with Budgie. The installation of Budgie also installed Gnome 40... so lot's to play with!!!
